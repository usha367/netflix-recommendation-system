# 🎬 Netflix Movie Recommendation System

A Netflix-style content-based movie recommendation system built using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.

## 🚀 Features
- Content-based filtering using genre metadata  
- TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction  
- Cosine similarity for similarity computation  
- Robust title normalization and fuzzy matching to handle imperfect user inputs  
- Top-N movie recommendations

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Jupyter / Google Colab

## 📌 How it Works
1. Movie metadata is vectorized using TF-IDF.
2. Cosine similarity is computed between movies.
3. User input is normalized and matched against dataset titles.
4. The system returns the top-N most similar movies.
